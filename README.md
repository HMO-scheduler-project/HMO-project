# HMO_Project
Hi you :)
This is our new HMO scheduler where you can manage your appointments and find relevant data.
The project was done mainly in java with a bit of CSS to make it prettier :)
We used MySQL for the database.
Please try it out by clicking on the jar file.
We would appriciate any comment you may have about the project.
Have a wonderful life :)
